# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is md5 but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#
# WARNING: While md5 is supported, do not use it due to the high chance
# of possible collisions and thus security breach.
#
# Prior to changing this value, the master should be stopped and all Salt
# caches should be cleared.
